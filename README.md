## Presentation

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

## Note

Cub3d project redo: only mandatory part now (no sprites in new subject).
The code is cleaner than my old cub3d.
You can check it, because the old one is complete.

## How_to_run

	cd ./new_cub3d
	make && ./cub3D map/map.cub
